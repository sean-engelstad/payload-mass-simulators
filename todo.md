## Platform structure
* Micah to build platform structure

## Tuning Fork
* [ ] Tobias to help with tuning fork structure

- [x] shape optimization with L1 tuning fork + 4 frequencies
- [ ] add mass, CG and failure index constraints (with inertial loads)
- [ ] verify modal analysis against TACS / Abaqus (concern about modes being right with tuning fork)
- [ ] optimize with 6 frequencies
- [ ] eigenvector / modal base force constraints with eigd library
