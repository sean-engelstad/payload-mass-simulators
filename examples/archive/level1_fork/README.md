# Tuning Fork with Beam Elements

* using beam elements now because sheet bodies in ESP/CAPS cause lots of topology changes when the widths of the sheets cross over other widths and that has become really annoying to deal with.
* going to use our own beam FEA solver, with hand-coded derivatives in this example.
